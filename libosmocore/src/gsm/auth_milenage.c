	/* Determine next SQN, according to 3GPP TS 33.102:
	 * SQN consists of SEQ and a lower significant part of IND bits:
	 *
	 * |----------SEQ------------|
	 * |------------------------SQN-----------|
	 *                           |-----IND----|
	 *
	 * The IND part is used as "slots": e.g. a given HLR client will always
	 * get the same IND part, called ind here, with incrementing SEQ. In
	 * the USIM, each IND slot enforces that its SEQ are used in ascending
	 * order -- as long as that constraint is satisfied, the SQN may jump
	 * forwards and backwards. For example, for ind_bitlen == 5, asking the
	 * USIM for SQN = 32, 64, 33 is allowed, because 32 and 64 are
	 * SEQ || (ind == 0), and though 33 is below 64, it is ind == 1 and
	 * allowed.  Not allowed would be 32, 96, 64, because 64 would go
	 * backwards after 96, both being ind == 0.
	 *
	 * From the last used SQN, we want to increment SEQ + 1, and then pick
	 * the matching IND part.
	 *
	 * IND size is suggested in TS 33.102 as 5 bits. SQN is 48 bits long.
	 * If ind_bitlen is passed too large here, the algorithms will break
	 * down. But at which point should we return an error? A sane limit
	 * seems to be ind_bitlen == 10, but to protect against failure,
	 * limiting ind_bitlen to 28 is enough, 28 being the number of bits
	 * suggested for the delta in 33.102, which is discussed to still
	 * require 2^15 > 32000 authentications to wrap the SQN back to the
	 * start.
	 *
	 * Note that if a caller with ind == 1 generates N vectors, the SQN
	 * stored after this will reflect SEQ + N. If then another caller with
	 * ind == 2 generates another N vectors, this will then use SEQ + N
	 * onwards and end up with SEQ + N + N. In other words, most of each
	 * SEQ's IND slots will remain unused. When looking at SQN being 48
	 * bits wide, after dropping ind_bitlen (say 5) from it, we will still
	 * have a sequence range of 2^43 = 8.8e12, eight trillion sequences,
	 * which is large enough to not bother further. With the maximum
	 * ind_bitlen of 28 enforced below, we still get more than 1 million
	 * sequences, which is also sufficiently large.
	 *
	 * An ind_bitlen of zero may be passed from legacy callers that are not
	 * aware of the IND extension. For these, below algorithm works out as
	 * before, simply incrementing SQN by 1.
	 *
	 * This is also a mechanism for tools like the osmo-auc-gen to directly
	 * request a given SQN to be used. With ind_bitlen == 0 the caller can
	 * be sure that this code will increment SQN by exactly one before
	 * generating a tuple, thus a caller would simply pass
	 * { .ind_bitlen = 0, .ind = 0, .sqn = (desired_sqn - 1) }
