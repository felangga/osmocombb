	""" Power measurement emulation for fake transceivers.

	There is no such thing like RF signal level in fake Um-interface,
	so we need to emulate this. The main idea is to have a list of
	all running and idle transceivers. As soon as a measurement
	request is received, FakePM will attempt to find a running
	transceiver on a given frequency.

	The result of such "measurement" is a random RSSI value
	in one of the following ranges:

	  - trx_min ... trx_max - if at least one TRX was found,
	  - noise_min ... noise_max - no TRX instances were found.

	FIXME: it would be great to average the rate of bursts
	       and indicated power / attenuation values for all
	       matching transceivers, so "pure traffic" ARFCNs
	       would be handled properly.
