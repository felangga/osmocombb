class Transceiver:
	""" Base transceiver implementation.

	Represents a single transceiver, that can be used as for the BTS side,
	as for the MS side. Each individual instance of Transceiver unifies
	three basic interfaces built on three independent UDP connections:

	  - CLCK (base port + 100/0) - clock indications from TRX to L1,
	  - CTRL (base port + 101/1) - control interface for L1,
	  - DATA (base port + 102/2) - bidirectional data interface for bursts.

	A transceiver can be either in active (i.e. working), or in idle mode.
	The active mode should ensure that both RX/TX frequencies are set.

	NOTE: CLCK is not required for some L1 implementations, so it is optional.

	== Timeslot configuration

	Transceiver has a list of active (i.e. configured) TDMA timeslots.
	The L1 should configure a timeslot before sending or expecting any
	data on it. This is done by SETSLOT control command, which also
	indicates an associated channel combination (see GSM TS 05.02).

	NOTE: we don't store the associated channel combinations,
	      as they are only useful for burst detection and demodulation.

	== Child transceivers

	A BTS can (optionally) have more than one transceiver. In this case
	additional (let's say child) transceivers basically share the same
	clock source of the first transceiver, so UDP port mapping is a bit
	different, for example:

	  (trx_0) clck=5700, ctrl=5701, data=5702,
	  (trx_1)            ctrl=5703, data=5704,
	  (trx_2)            ctrl=5705, data=5706.
	  ...

	As soon as the first transceiver is powered on / off,
	all child transceivers are also powered on / off.

	== Clock distribution (optional)

	The clock indications are not expected by L1 when transceiver
	is not running, so we monitor both POWERON / POWEROFF events
	from the control interface, and keep the list of CLCK links
	in a given CLCKGen instance updated. The clock generator is
	started and stopped automatically.

	NOTE: a single instance of CLCKGen can be shared between multiple
	      transceivers, as well as multiple transceivers may use
	      individual CLCKGen instances.

	== Power Measurement (optional)

	Transceiver may have an optional power measurement interface,
	that shall provide at least one method: measure(freq). This
	is required for the MS side (i.e. OsmocomBB).

	== Frequency hopping (optional)

	There are two ways to implement frequency hopping:

	  a) The Transceiver is configured with the hopping parameters, in
	     particular HSN, MAIO, and the list of ARFCNs (channels), so the
	     actual Rx/Tx frequencies are changed by the Transceiver itself
	     depending on the current TDMA frame number.

	  b) The L1 maintains several Transceivers (two or more), so each
	     instance is assigned one dedicated RF carrier frequency, and
	     hence the number of available hopping frequencies is equal to
	     the number of Transceivers. In this case, it's the task of
	     the L1 to commutate bursts between Transceivers (frequencies).

	Variant a) is commonly known as "synthesizer frequency hopping"
	whereas b) is known as "baseband frequency hopping".

	For the MS side, a) is preferred, because a phone usually has only
	one Transceiver (per RAT). On the other hand, b) is more suitable
	for the BTS side, because it's relatively easy to implement and
	there is no technical limitation on the amount of Transceivers.

	FakeTRX obviously does support b) since multi-TRX feature has been
	implemented, as well as a) by resolving UL/DL frequencies using a
	preconfigured (by the L1) set of the hopping parameters. The later
	can be enabled using the SETFH control command.

	NOTE: in the current implementation, mode a) applies to the whole
	Transceiver and all its timeslots, so using in for the BTS side
	does not make any sense (imagine BCCH hopping together with DCCH).
