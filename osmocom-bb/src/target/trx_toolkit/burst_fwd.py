class BurstForwarder(TRXList):
	""" Performs burst forwarding between transceivers.

	BurstForwarder distributes bursts between the list of given
	FakeTRX (Transceiver) instances depending on the following
	parameters of each transceiver:

	  - execution state (running or idle),
	  - actual RX / TX frequencies,
	  - list of active timeslots.

	Each to be distributed 'TxMsg' message is being transformed
	into a 'RxMsg' message, and then forwarded to transceivers
	with partially initialized header. All uninitialized header
	fields (such as rssi and toa256) shall be set by each
	transceiver individually before sending towards the L1.

		# so let's precalculate its Tx frequency in advance
		tx_freq = src_trx.get_tx_freq(rx_msg.fn)

			del rx_msg.burst # burst bits are omited
			rx_msg.burst = None
